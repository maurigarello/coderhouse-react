# Coderhouse REACT JS

# MauriMart - Ecommerce.

Hello! My name is Mauricio Garello and this is my final project for the React JS course at CODERHOUSE.

In this repository, I share all the elements that make up my project, which was a simulation of an ecommerce with a cart, and a purchase order issued through firebase.

It consists of:

> * Layout of the application using HTML5, CSS3 and Tailwind CSS.
> * Storage in the cloud, using firebase.
> * Logic implemented using States, Hooks, UseEffect, Promises, Async & Await.

In it, I faced the challenge of building a fully functional and user-friendly e-commerce from scratch.
